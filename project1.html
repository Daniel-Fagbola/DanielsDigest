            Daniel's Digest
        </h1>
        <p>
            Daniel's Digest is the first personal project I undertook.
             All be it not the most refined, especially upon its 
             initial release. It was very important to me that 
             I put the methodologies from my classwork into practice.

        <div class="goal">
            <h2>Goal</h2>
            The primary goal of Teach Speaks was to create a website that was 
            professional enough that I would feel comfortable showing it to 
            potential employers while also being relaxed enough that I 
            actually felt eager enough to update it with my own 
            projects in real-time. I enjoy coding and have many 
            large-scale projects I would one day like to complete. 
            Rather than completing a project that's recommended solely 
            for the skills I may learn. Coding this website gave me 
            those skills in addition to having functional usage 
            and personal necessity.

        <div class="insights">
            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>The biggest lesson to come from this project was a reinforcement 
                concerning scope and some of the lesser talk about factors
                that influence it. When looking at the project management
                triangle scope is taught in tandem with cost and time. 
                One factor that I underestimated having an impact was 
                knowledge. From the very beginning of this project, I learned 
                how many things I didn't know. At certain points, it 
                became impossible to stick not only to the original scope, 
                but also to the cost and time put into this project as 
                a whole, and individual components varied tremendously. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="improvements">
            <h2>Improvements</h2>
            <p>There is plenty of space for improvements, both in the 
                process of conceptualizing and then actualizing a project 
                as well as maintaining and updating a project. As 
                the initial phase of this project is now complete, 
                further updates will stand as a testament to my ability 
                to complete post-launch work while simultaneously 
                working on other projects.</p>
